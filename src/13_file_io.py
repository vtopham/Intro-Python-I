"""
Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

# YOUR CODE HERE
text_file = open('foo.txt', "r")
inside_text = text_file.read()
text_file.close()
print(inside_text)

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain



# YOUR CODE HERE

new_file = open('bar.txt', "w")
new_file.write("Ooh la la")
new_file.close()
